This project uses 2 different APIs, one for searching flights and one for google sheets. I'm using my google sheets to store destinations I
would like to visit and lowest price I'm willing to pay for them. Then the program tries to search for cheaper flights than those in the google sheet.
If it finds any, it will send an email about it.
